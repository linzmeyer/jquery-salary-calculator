THIS IS A LIST OF PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS THAT I RAN INTO WHILE CREATING THIS PROJECT. THIS MAY COME IN HANDY LATER IF I RUN INTO THE SAME ISSUES IN THE FUTURE.

--- 1. undefined values in global object literal -------------------------------

Problem: I created my DOMstrings object globally before the APP START section.

I used jQuery library and used the $( document ).ready( function ) method.  
I attempted to create an object literal that would populate using DOM id's.
The DOM id's had no values because this object literal was defined before the
DOM was with the jQuery .ready() method.

Solution: Either A. or B. or C

JUST DON'T TRY TO INITIALIZE SOMETHING BEFORE IT EXISTS!

A. Place object (as well as anything else using DOM values to initialize 
your program values) inside of the $( document ).ready( function ) method. If
you need your values to be global, simply use the window object to do so.

B. Place object (or DOM values) after jQuer.ready() method.

C. I chose this. Create a function that creates the object literal. Called it
getUserInputs

--- 2. Unexpected ')'. (E024)	); -----------------------------------------------

Problem: I keep running into this error when messing with object properties.
Solution: It's likely that you have a trailing comma.
